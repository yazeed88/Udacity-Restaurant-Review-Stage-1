# Resturant Review Project - Stage 1
---

A website that shows a map with multiple restaurants identified, you are given the option to filter the restaurants based on the type of cuisine and location, and you can read some reviews about each restaurant.

## Running The Website

1. Download the website files.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 3000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 3000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`, and the website will be running.
